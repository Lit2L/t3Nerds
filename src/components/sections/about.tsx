          Life can be rough for the peaceful nerds of the world. We want to
          invite you to our gym to experience a welcoming No matter who you are,
          what your are doing or where you are, Why do we want to be big and
          strong? Why is it more comfortable for you when people fear you? Among

            Fear and Anxiety
          </span>{' '}
          seems to dominate our being the most. Speaking from experience, I
          understand that fear and anxiety could alter almost every decision we
          make, every thought we think and even derail your growth as a human
          being. Imagine coming back from the market empty handed because you
          weren&apos;t able to voice your order to the clerk without people
          possibly making fun of your voice. Your confidence should not hinge on
          the chance of always being the biggest. Instead of leaving your ursuit
          because it would likely result in more respect for yourself, less
          disrespect from others and feeling comfortable in your own skin. We
          know your struggles and we are here to let you know that we are here
          to help you. Is fighting the answer? No, but you would be surprised
          how much weight gets lifted off your shoulders when you know how to
          handle yourself in a fight. The more fear we can remove from your mind
          the more you can focus on things that matter like enjoying yourself in
          public.
